        I started coding in Feburary 2016, mainly to solve algorithmic problems appeared in various contests.
        My primary language is C++ (although I started picking up Python 2 recently for Datathon purposes).
        The collection of cool problems I have solved can be found <a href="https://github.com/Anzoteh96/Cpp-algorithms">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the awards I have won on the online programming platforms are: 
        <ul>
            <li>HackerRank Week of Code 32: Gold medal (ranked 174/8433)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoted to O(1) rating category (top 1% among all users)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HackerRank Week of Code 24: Gold medal (ranked 189/9133)</li>
            <li>LeetCode Weekly Contest 34: ranked 26/1557</li>
            <li>USACO December 2016: Perfect Score (Bronze and Silver Divisions)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoted to Gold Division</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        My first Hackathon was the Equithon held at University of Waterloo in May 2017. 
        In addition, I was selected (via an assessment) to take part in the Waterloo Datathon in May 2017 hosted by Correlation One and Citadel LLC.

    <h2>Research Experience</h2>
    <p>
        As mentioned in my home page, I am doing a research on finding weakly connected components in a graph. 
        The task of finding a weakly connected component can be rephrased as below:
        <q>
            Given a group of people, some pairs of them are friends (and friendship is mutual). 
            For each pair of people A and B, do there exist a set of people from the group, 
            such that we can line them up with A on one end and B on the other end, and any two neighbouring people on the line are friends?
        </q>
        Although various algorithms exist (breadth-first search, depth-first search, quick-find, quick-union), 
        most (if not all) of them cannot update the set of connected components efficiently in the case of edge deletion. 
        This is what I am working on right now, and I will update more after my research positionship ends in late August!
