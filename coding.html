    <h1>My Coding Experience</h1>
</head>
<body>
    <p>
        I started coding in Feburary 2016, mainly to solve algorithmic problems appeared in various contests.
        My primary language is C++ (although I started picking up Python 2 recently for Datathon purposes).
        The collection of cool problems I have solved can be found <a href="https://github.com/Anzoteh96/Cpp-algorithms">here</a>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the awards I have won on the online programming platforms are: 
        <ul>
            <li>HackerRank Week of Code 32: Gold medal (ranked 174/8433)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoted to O(1) rating category (top 1% among all users)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>HackerRank Week of Code 24: Gold medal (ranked 189/9133)</li>
            <li>LeetCode Weekly Contest 34: ranked 26/1557</li>
            <li>USACO December 2016: Perfect Score (Bronze and Silver Divisions)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Promoted to Gold Division</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Hackathon Experience: Equithon 2017</h2>
    <p>
        On May 5-7, 2017, I participated in my first hackathon: the Equithon held at the University of Waterloo. 
        The problem that my teammates and I worked on was the fact that there were people with ideas and insights but do not have the skills to implement them. 
        On the other hand, there were also people with advanced skills in their related fields yet do not have the insights to see which problems to solve. 
        Hence we developed a website to connected the two types of people.

    <h2>Datathon Experience: Waterloo Datathon 2017</h2>
    <p>
        On May 13, 2017, I was selected to take part in the Waterloo Datathon (through an assessment). 
        The task given on the day was to draw conclusion based on the data on pickups by Uber and other transportation method in different areas. 
        My teammates and I decided to relate this data to the crime rate happening in the respective cities (using another dataset we searched on our own). 
        Using statisical languages like R and Python, we drew a conclusion that public transportation is less perferred in areas with high crime rates.

        <h2>Research Experience</h2>
        <p>
            As mentioned in my home page, I just finished doing a research on finding weakly connected components in a graph.
            The task of finding a weakly connected component can be rephrased as below:
            <q>
                Given a group of people, some pairs of them are friends (and friendship is mutual).
                For each pair of people A and B, do there exist a set of people from the group,
                such that we can line them up with A on one end and B on the other end, and any two neighbouring people on the line are friends?
            </q>
            Although various algorithms exist (breadth-first search, depth-first search, quick-find, quick-union),
            most (if not all) of them cannot update the set of connected components efficiently in the case of edge deletion.
        </p>
        <p>
            A crucial observation in solving this mega-problem is that, in general, the probability of a connected component being split into two upon edge deletion is rather small. 
            Having this in mind, and having familiarized myself with the existing algorithms in a static setting, I started off by modifying the features of the existing algorithms:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Breadth-first search: record the distance of each vertex from a selected vertex of its component. Deletion of an edge joining vertices of the same distance does not change the connected components. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Quick-union: select some edges that will form a forest (that is, collection of trees). Deletion of edge that do not form a forest won't change the connected components. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            As compared to the naive algorithm of repeating the same algorithm (used for static setting), these algorithms managed to reduce the running time by 5000 times. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The final part of my research concerns about making these algorithms work in parallel processing (that is, multitasking). 
            After designing the algorithm on paper, I explored two technologies: OpenMP and Message Passing Interface (MPI). 
            Under the advice of my supervisor, I chose to move on with MPI due to the private memory assigned to each processor (which makes it easier to scale to big numbers). 
            In the end of my research, I constructed a framework of the algorithms aforementioned that conatains the idea behind it.
