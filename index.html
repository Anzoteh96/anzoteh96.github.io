    <p title="About me">
        Hello there! I am Anzo Zhao Yang Teh,
        a Malaysian student currently pursuing a Mathematics degree at the University of Waterloo.
    </p>
    <h2>I have a love for...</h2>
    <h3>Mathematics</h3>
    <p>
        In my personal statement submitted to <a href="https://www.ucas.com/">UCAS</a> (in applying to a Mathematics degree in UK universities back then), 
        I began with the following quote:
        <q>
            I have always been fascinated by maths’ endless room for conjecture that begat different principles and theorems.
        </q>
        Indeed, the process of generating insights to justify mathematical statements have fascinated me since I joined the Malaysian International Mathematical Olmpiad (henceforth denoted as IMO) training camp in November 2010:
        so intriguing that I am willing to spend hours (or even days) just to think of a problem. 
        Cracking even one mathematical problem can get me occupied for a few hours in a row, and it can be frustrating when no progress can be made. 
        Nevertheless, my biggest motivation that moves me forward is the feel of accomplishment as I finally managed to tackle these difficult puzzles. 
        In fact, I ended my personal statement with the following sentences:
        <q>
            I have not been able to refrain from spending hours on proving theorems presented in textbooks and conquering maths problems from different contests. 
            The adventure of ‘researching’ various topics beyond textbook level (such as quadratic residues) has been equally rewarding.
        </q>
    </p>
    <h4>Project 1: <a href="JOM 2013.html">Junior Olympiad of Mathematics</a></h4>
    <p>
        In 2013, I turned my passion into co-initiating the Junior Olympiad of Mathematics with Justin Lim. 
        Together with the other experienced participants in the training camp, we collectively created 29 brand-new and insightful problems for the Olympiad. 
        In turned out to be a great opportunity for us to practice our leadership skills, too. 
    </p>
    <h4>Project 2: Leisure Proof Writing</h4>
    <p>
        <b><a href="https://github.com/Anzoteh96/Math-Proofs/blob/master/imo2016_sl.pdf">Solutions to Selected Problems on the IMO 2016 shortlist. </a></b>
        The problemset was made public after the 2017 IMO, and I plan to write the solutions to the problems I managed to solve. 
        Still an ongoing process!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><a href="https://anzoteh96.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/imo-2015-sl.pdf">Solutions to Selected Problems on the IMO 2015 shortlist.</a></b> 
        The problems of the IMO 2015 shortlist was kept confidential until IMO 2016, and were used as assessment materials in the IMO 2016 training camps. 
        Having tried the problems during the training camps (as a trainer/facilitator), I decided to compile the solutions to the problems I have solved into a file, 
        in the hope that others can benefit from my mathematical insights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b><a href="https://anzoteh96.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/proofs1.pdf">Proof of Identities in G.C.E. A-Levels Mathematics and Further Mathematics.</a></b> 
        Back in my A-Levels, I was introduced to several different mathematical identities (especially in Further Mathematics). 
        I had the penchant for proving those identities, but it's not until I graduated from the program did I start to write up the proofs in LaTeX. 
    </p>
    <h3>Teaching</h3>
    <p>
        What can be better than imparting my passion to audience who is eager to understand exactly what I have already known? 
        Inspired by a classmate (Spencer), I hosted two review sessions (one on Advanced Calculus 2, the other on Advanced Linear Algebra 1) for my classmates before the final exam in April 2017. 
        The aim of the sessions was to reinforce the knowledge of every attendee to the sessions.

    <h4>Teaching Experience 1: Training and facilitating at the International Mathematical Olympiad training camp</h4>
    <p>
        In January 2016, I accepted Mr. Suhaimi's (the head coach for Malaysian Math Olympiad team) offer to train the students selected into the IMO camp. 
        Not only I was privileged to speak about my favourite topics in geometry, my mathematical craze and obsession was also rekindled in the process of preparing the handouts for students. 
        For more information on what I have done, visit <a href="trainer_diary.html">this page</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Teaching Experience 2: Tutoring students on Math Olympiad</h4>
    <p>
        In June 2016, I started giving lessons on advanced topics in Math Olympiad to 2 of the students who were among the 24 students selected into the IMO training camps held in March 2016. 
        More information could be found <a href="https://github.com/Anzoteh96/Math-Olympiad-teaching">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Blogging and Writing</h3>
    <p>
        No prescribed topic. No required format. This allows me to depict my thoughts and experiences, and to share my things on my Wordpress webpage. 
    </p>
    <h4>Writing Project: Project Insights</h4>
    <p>
        Like my other ambitious comrades in the A-Levels, I aspired to study in the top universities around the world. 
        This, however, added substantial amount of toil to us (with various admission tests, essays and recommendation letters to be done). 
    </p>
    <p>
        My close friend, Lumo Woong, then came out with this idea of initiating Project Insights that aimed to illuminate future college applicants on the process, 
        the do's and dont's along the way. 
        I accepted his invitation into his team, and wrote three articles on it:
        <ul>
            <li>The process of asking for financial aid from colleges in US</li>
            <li>My experience of having an MIT interview</li>
            <li>A writeup describing my college decision process</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Coding</h3>
    <p>
        Why code? From the viewpoint of a mathematics lover, codes help us to overcome our limitations in doing computations and solving problems. 
    </p>
    <h4>Research Experience: Finding weakly connected components in a dynamic graph</h4>
    Still ongoing, but it's very code-heavy! Stay tuned for more updates!
    <h3>Music</h3>
    The only instrument I play is piano, but it's enough to carry me forward. 
    It has been a privilege to appreciate the masterpieces by the greatest musicians in the history. 
    <h4>Project 1: High School Graduation Song Composition</h4>
    I wrote a song that was selected as the Graduation Song of Class of 2013 in Chung Ling Buterworth.
    <h4>Project 2: A-Level Graduation Performance</h4>
