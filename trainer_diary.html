        <h1>IMO 2016 Trainings</h1>
        <p>
            I was invited by Mr. Suhaimi Ramly, the head coach of the training camps to deliver geometry lectures in the IMO 2016 training camps in January, March (pre-APMO camp) and April. 
        </p>
        <h2>IMO 2016 Camp 2: January 12-16, 2016</h2>
        <h3>Lecture Delivered: Trigonometric Tricks in Solving Geometry Problems</h3>
        <p>
            The basics and fundamentals are almost the same as posted on my <a href="trigonometry.html">Trigonometry</a> page. 
            This lecture was given to the students who had not attended training camps in any of the previous years. 
            The problems with solutions included in the handouts were:

                    Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle with altitudes $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$, and let $O$ be the center of its circumcircle. Show that the segments $OA$, $OF$, $OB$, $OD$, $OC$, $OE$ dissect the triangle $ABC$ into three pairs of triangles that have equal areas.

            <p>
                The problem solving session was themed on the same as that given in my lecture of trigonometry, except that this was targetted to a more experience group of students. 
                As such, the solution to the following difficult problem was demonstrated to the students:

        <h3>Lectures Delivered: Geometry Big Guns</h3>
        <p>
            During that camp, Justin Lim (IMO 2014 gold medallist, currently an undergraduate at MIT) and I collectively covered a few advanced level tricks in geometry. 
            They are detailed below (together with the problems solvable using these theorems):

        <h3>Problem solving session conducted: <a href="http://www.turgor.ru/lktg/2012/5/index.htm">Fair cake division</a></h3>
        <p>
            This is another project I did at the Summer Conference mentioned above, partnered with Justin. 
            The project is to solve the following general problem: 
            There are $m$ cakes, each with weight 1. 
            We are to divide the cake into slices and distribute them to $n$ people such that everyone gets equal total weight of cake (that is, $\frac{m}{n}$).
            Determine the maximum $k$ such that each <i>slice</i> has weight at least $k$ 
            (basically, maximize the minimum possible slice). 
            Notice that in the official handout this quantity $k$ is denoted as $f(m,n)$.

            Some auxillary results I discussed in the problem solving session were: 
            <ul>
                <li>$f(m, km)=\frac{1}{k}$ for all positive integers $k, m$.</li>
                <li>$f(km, m)=1$ for all positive inetegers $k, m$. </li>
                <li>$f(m, n)\le\frac{m}{2n}$ for all $m, n$ such that $m$ does not divide $n$. </li>
                <li>$f(m, n)\ge \frac{m}{3n}$ for all $m, n$ sastisfying $m\le n$. 
                When $\frac 23\le\frac mn\le\frac  34$, equality holds. 
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Remarkably, Justin and I submitted a solution to finding $f(31, 52)$ that was highly commended by the committee members (during the conference).
            Have fun trying before looking at the answer!

            Answer: $f(31, 52)=\frac{89}{364}$.
