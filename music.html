    <h1>My Musical Background</h1>
    For time being, I will first tell about a composing project I have done for my high school. 
    <h2>
        Graduation Song Composition
    </h2>
    <h3>
        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        My high school (Chung Ling High School Butterworth) has a tradition of having one unique graduation song for each graduating class. 
        In 2013, six teams (including mine) submitted their proposals for the Class of 2013 Graduation Song. 
        Among the four pieces shortlisted by the graduation committee, my piece was elected as the graduation song of the year with a majority of 25 votes 
        (156 vs 131).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Motivation Behind
    </h3>
    <p>
        The melodic phrase "A-D-C#-D-A-D-D-E-F#" has been there in my head since Grade 7 (2009). 
        "Wouldn't it be great if I could use it somewhere in a musical composition?" I thought. 
        It's not until 2012 did I know that I am eligible to submit a graudation piece proposal, 
        and I decided to do it. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A tougher question then confounded me: how, then, should I expand from that catchy phrase into something complete?
        Using my knowledge on rules of chord progression, I tried to concoct some melody by experimenting on my piano, 
        hoping that they will form something melodious. 
        Subsequently, I formed my team of lyricists, arranger, and singer with my completed piece, 
        before making a preliminary recording with that. 
        Finally, we made a studio-recorded version after winning the bidding contest. 
    </p>

        The recording is available at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0jTXYR4i1A">Youtube</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ryan-goi/studio-version?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=facebook">Soundcloud</a>. Enjoy listening!
